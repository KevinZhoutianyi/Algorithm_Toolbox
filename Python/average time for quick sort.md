for example if we want to get the probability that 4 & 6 are compared

when the pivot number is >6 or <4, it has nothing to two with whether 4 & 6 will compare 

only when the pivot number is <= 6 and >=4, the decide whether 4 & 6 will be compared

## therefore the probability for comparing is when pivot number is 4~6 and the pivot number is 4 or 6 and they will be compared

## the formula can be derived as  2/(j-i+1)

for each comparison, the expected value of the time of work can be derived
